Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning
Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning repository! This project aims to revolutionize industrial maintenance by employing advanced machine learning techniques to predict and prevent equipment failures before they occur.

Overview
Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to equipment management, optimizing maintenance schedules, minimizing downtime, and ultimately increasing operational efficiency. In this repository, you will find a comprehensive set of tools and models designed to analyze historical equipment data and predict potential failures.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Explore our data preprocessing scripts to understand how we clean and prepare historical data for predictive modeling.

Model Training: Discover our machine learning models, implemented in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, designed to predict equipment failures based on historical patterns.

Real-Time Monitoring: Learn how to implement real-time monitoring of equipment health, enabling early detection of abnormalities and improving response time.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of our predictive maintenance models using industry-standard metrics, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.

Getting Started
Installation: Clone this repository and follow the installation instructions in the Installation Guide.

Data Preparation: Use the provided Jupyter notebooks to preprocess and explore the historical equipment data.

Model Training: Train your predictive maintenance models using the scripts in the models directory.
